# Plan for Windows Defender Application Control lifecycle policy management

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016 and above

This topic describes the decisions you need to make to establish the processes for managing and maintaining Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies.

## Policy XML lifecycle management

Before you begin deploying WDAC, consider how your policies will be managed and maintained over time. Developing a process for managing WDAC policies helps assure that WDAC continues to effectively control how applications are allowed to run in your organization.

<!-- We should insert a diagram to show this visually -->
Most WDAC policies will evolve over time and proceed through a set of identifiable phases during their lifetime. Typically, these phases include:

1. [Define (or refine) the "circle-of-trust"](understand-windows-defender-application-control-policy-design-decisions.md) for the policy and build an audit mode version of the policy XML.
2. Deploy the audit mode policy to intended computers.
3. Monitor audit block events from the intended computers and add/edit/delete rules as needed to address unexpected/unwanted blocks.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the remaining block events meet expectations.
5. Generate the enforced mode version of the policy.
6. Deploy the enforced mode policy to intended computers. We recommend using staged rollouts for enforced policies to detect and respond to issues before deploying the policy broadly.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 anytime the desired "circle-of-trust" changes.  

### Keep WDAC policies in a source control or document management solution

To effectively manage WDAC policies, you should store and maintain your policy XML documents in a central repository that is accessible to everyone responsible for WDAC policy management. We recommend a source control solution such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) or a document management solution such as [Office 365 SharePoint](https://products.office.com/sharepoint/collaboration), which provide version control and allow you to specify metadata about the XML documents.

### Set PolicyName, PolicyID, and Version metadata for each policy

Use the [Set-CIPolicyIDInfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/configci/set-cipolicyidinfo) cmdlet to give each policy a descriptive name and set a unique ID in order to differentiate each policy when reviewing WDAC events or when viewing the policy XML document. Although you can specify a string value for PolicyId, for policies using the multiple policy format we recommend using the -ResetPolicyId switch to let the system auto-generate a unique ID for the policy.

> [!NOTE]
> PolicyID only applies to policies using the [multiple policy format](deploy-multiple-windows-defender-application-control-policies.md) on computers running Windows 10, version 1903 and above. Running -ResetPolicyId on a policy created for pre-1903 computers will convert it to multiple policy format and prevent it from running on those earlier versions of Windows 10.
> PolicyID should be set only once per policy and use different PolicyID's for the audit and enforced mode versions of each policy.

In addition, we recommend using the [Set-CIPolicyVersion](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/configci/set-cipolicyversion) cmdlet to increment the policy's internal version number when you make changes to the policy. The version must be defined as a standard four-part version string (e.g. "1.0.0.0").

### Policy rule updates

As new apps are deployed or existing apps are updated by the software publisher, you may need to make revisions to your rules to ensure that these apps run correctly. Whether policy rule updates are required will depend significantly on the types of rules your policy includes. Rules based on codesigning certificates provide the most resiliency against app changes while rules based on file attributes or hash are most likely to require updates when apps change. Alternatively, if you leverage WDAC [managed installer](use-windows-defender-application-control-with-managed-installer.md) functionality and consistently deploy all apps and their updates through your managed installer, then you are less likely to need policy updates.

## WDAC event management

Each time that a process is blocked by WDAC, events will be written to either the CodeIntegrity\Operational or the AppLocker\MSI and Script Windows event logs. The event details which file tried to run, the attributes of that file and its signatures, and the process that attempted to run the blocked file.

Collecting these events in a central location can help you maintain your WDAC policy and troubleshoot rule configuration problems. Event collection technologies such as those available in Windows allow administrators to subscribe to specific event channels and have the events from source computers aggregated into a forwarded event log on a Windows Server operating system collector. For more info about setting up an event subscription, see [Configure Computers to Collect and Forward Events](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=145012).

Additionally, WDAC events are collected by [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection) and can be queried using the [advanced hunting](querying-application-control-events-centrally-using-advanced-hunting.md) feature.

## Application and user support policy

Considerations include:

-   What type of end-user support is provided for blocked applications?
-   How are new rules added to the policy?
-   How are existing rules updated?
-   Are events forwarded for review?

### Help desk support

If your organization has an established help desk support department in place, consider the following when deploying WDAC policies:

-   What documentation does your support department require for new policy deployments?
-   What are the critical processes in each business group both in work flow and timing that will be affected by application control policies and how could they affect your support department's workload?
-   Who are the contacts in the support department?
-   How will the support department resolve application control issues between the end user and those who maintain the WDAC rules?

### End-user support

Because WDAC is preventing unapproved apps from running, it is important that your organization carefully plan how to provide end-user support. Considerations include:

-   Do you want to use an intranet site as a first line of support for users who have tried to run a blocked app?
-   How do you want to support exceptions to the policy? Will you allow users to run a script to temporarily allow access to a blocked app?

## Document your plan

After deciding how your organization will manage your WDAC policy, record your findings.

-   **End-user support policy.** Document the process that you will use for handling calls from users who have attempted to run a blocked app, and ensure that support personnel have clear escalation steps so that the administrator can update the WDAC policy, if necessary.
-   **Event processing.** Document whether events will be collected in a central location called a store, how that store will be archived, and whether the events will be processed for analysis.
-   **Policy management.** Detail what policies are planned, how they will be managed, and how rules will be maintained over time.

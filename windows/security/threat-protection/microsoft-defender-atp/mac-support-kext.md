# Troubleshoot kernel extension issues in Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP) for Mac](microsoft-defender-atp-mac.md)

This topic provides information on how to troubleshoot issues with the kernel extension that is installed as part of Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac.

Starting with macOS High Sierra (10.13), macOS requires all kernel extensions to be explicitly approved before they are allowed to run on the device.

If you did not approve the kernel extension during the deployment / installation of Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac, then the application displays a banner prompting you to enable it:

You can also run ```mdatp --health```. It reports if real-time protection is enabled but not available. This is an indication that the kernel extension is not approved to run on your device.

```bash
$ mdatp --health
...
realTimeProtectionAvailable             : false
realTimeProtectionEnabled               : true
...
```

The following sections provide guidance on how to address this issue, depending on the method that you used to deploy Microsoft Defender ATP for Mac.

## Managed deployment

See the instructions corresponding to the management tool that you used to deploy the product:

- [JAMF-based deployment](mac-install-with-jamf.md#configuration-profile)
- [Microsoft Intune-based deployment](mac-install-with-intune.md#create-system-configuration-profiles)

## Manual deployment

If less than 30 minutes have passed since the product was installed, navigate to **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy**, where you have to **Allow** system software from developers "Microsoft Corporation".

If you don't see this prompt, it means that 30 or more minutes have passed, and the kernel extension still not been approved to run on your device:

In this case, you need to perform the following steps to trigger the approval flow again.

1. In Terminal, attempt to install the driver. The following operation will fail, because the kernel extension was not approved to run on the device, however it will trigger the approval flow again.

    ```bash
    $ sudo kextutil /Library/Extensions/wdavkext.kext
    Kext rejected due to system policy: <OSKext 0x7fc34d528390 [0x7fffa74aa8e0]> { URL = "file:///Library/StagedExtensions/Library/Extensions/wdavkext.kext/", ID = "com.microsoft.wdavkext" }
    Kext rejected due to system policy: <OSKext 0x7fc34d528390 [0x7fffa74aa8e0]> { URL = "file:///Library/StagedExtensions/Library/Extensions/wdavkext.kext/", ID = "com.microsoft.wdavkext" }
    Diagnostics for /Library/Extensions/wdavkext.kext:
    ```

2. Open **System Preferences** > **Security & Privacy** from the menu. (Close it first, if it's opened.)

3. **Allow** system software from developers "Microsoft Corporation"

4. In Terminal, install the driver again. This time the operation will succeed:

```bash
$ sudo kextutil /Library/Extensions/wdavkext.kext
```

The banner should disappear from the Defender application, and ```mdatp --health``` should now report that real-time protection is both enabled and available:

```bash
$ mdatp --health
...
realTimeProtectionAvailable             : true
realTimeProtectionEnabled               : true
...
```

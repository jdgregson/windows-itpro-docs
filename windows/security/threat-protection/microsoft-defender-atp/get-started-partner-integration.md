# Become a Microsoft Defender ATP partner

**Applies to:** 
- [Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (Microsoft Defender ATP)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

To become a Microsoft Defender ATP solution partner, you'll need to follow and complete the following steps.

## Step 1: Subscribe to a Microsoft Defender ATP Developer license
Subscribing to the [Microsoft Defender ATP Developer license](https://winatpregistration-prd.trafficmanager.net/Developer/UserAgreement?Length=9) allows you to use a Microsoft Defender ATP tenant with up to 10 devices for developing solutions to integrate with Microsoft Defender ATP. 

## Step 2: Fulfill the solution validation and certification requirements
The best way for technology partners to certify their integration works, is to have a joint customer approve the suggested integration design and have it tested and demoed to the Microsoft Defender ATP team.

Once the Microsoft Defender ATP team has reviewed and approves the integration, we will direct you to be included as a partner at the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association.

## Step 3: Become a  Microsoft Intelligent Security Association member
[Microsoft Intelligent Security Association](https://www.microsoft.com/security/partnerships/intelligent-security-association) is a program specifically for Microsoft security partners to help enrich your security products and improve customer discoverability of your integrations to Microsoft security products.

## Step 4: Get listed in the Microsoft Defender ATP partner application portal
Microsoft Defender ATP supports third-party applications discovery and integration using the in-product [partner page](partner-applications.md) that is embedded within the Microsoft Defender ATP management portal. 

To have your company listed as a partner in the in-product partner page, you will need to provide the following:

1. A square logo (SVG).
2. Name of the product to be presented.
3. Provide a 15-word product description.
4. Link to the landing page for the customer to complete the integration or blog post that will include sufficient information for customers. Please note that any press release including the Microsoft Defender ATP product name should be reviewed by the marketing and engineering teams. You should allow at least 10 days for review process to be performed.
5.	If you use a multi-tenant Azure AD approach, we will need the AAD application name to track usage of the application.


Partnership with Microsoft Defender ATP help our mutual customers to further streamline, integrate, and orchestrate defenses. We are happy that you chose to become a Microsoft Defender ATP partner and to achieve our common goal of effectively protecting customers and their assets by preventing and responding to modern threats together.

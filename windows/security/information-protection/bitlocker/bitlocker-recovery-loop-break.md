# Breaking out of a Bitlocker recovery loop

Sometimes, following a crash, you might be unable to successfully boot into your operating system, due to the recovery screen repeatedly prompting you to enter your recovery key. This can be very frustrating.

If you've entered the correct Bitlocker recovery key multiple times, and are still unable to continue past the initial recovery screen, follow these steps to break out of the loop.

> [!NOTE]
> Only try these steps after you have restarted your device at least once.

1. On the initial recovery screen, don't enter your recovery key. Instead, select **Skip this drive**.

1. On the next screen, select **Troubleshoot**.

1. On the Troubleshoot screen, select **Advanced options**.

1. On the Advanced options screen, select **Command prompt**.

1. From the WinRE command prompt, manually unlock your drive: `manage-bde.exe -unlock C: -rp <recovery password>`

1. Suspend operating system drive protection: `manage-bde.exe -protectors -disable C:`

1. Once the last command is run, you can safely exit the command prompt and continue to boot into your operating system

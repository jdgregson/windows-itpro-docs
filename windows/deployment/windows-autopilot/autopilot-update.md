# Windows Autopilot update

**Applies to**

-   WindowsÂ 10, version 1903

Windows Autopilot update enables you to get the latest Autopilot features and critical issue fixes without the need to move to latest Windows OS version. With Autopilot update, organizations can keep their current OS version and still benefit from new Autopilot features and bug fixes.
 
During the Autopilot deployment process, Windows Autopilot update has been added as a new node after the critical [Windows Zero Day Patch (ZDP) update](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/windows-updates-during-oobe) check. During the update process, Windows Autopilot devices reach out to Windows Update to check for a new Autopilot update.  If there is an Autopilot update available, the device will download and install the update, then restart automatically. See the following example.

The following diagram illustrates a typical Windows Autopilot deployment orchestration during the Out of Box Experience (OOBE) with the new Windows Autopilot update node.

## Release cadence

- When an Autopilot update is available, it is typically released on the 4th Tuesday of the month. The update could be released on a different week if there is an exception.
- A knowledge base (KB) article will also be published to document the changes that are included in the update.

For a list of released updates, see [Autopilot update history](windows-autopilot-whats-new.md#windows-autopilot-update-history).

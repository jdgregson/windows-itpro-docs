# Managing HoloLens updates

HoloLens uses Windows Update, just like other Windows 10 devices. When an update is available, it will be automatically downloaded and installed the next time your device is plugged in and connected to the Internet.

This article will walk through all of the way to manage updates on HoloLens.

## Manually check for updates

While HoloLens periodically checks for system updates so you don't have to, there may be circumstances in which you want to manually check.

To manually check for updates, go to **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Check for updates**. If the Settings app says your device is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.

## Go back to a previous version (HoloLens 2)

In some cases, you might want to go back to a previous version of the HoloLens software. You can do this by using the Advanced Recovery Companion to reset your HoloLens to the earlier version.

> [!NOTE]
> Going back to an earlier version deletes your personal files and settings.

To go back to a previous version of HoloLens 2, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you don't have any phones or Windows devices plugged in to your PC.
1. On your PC, download the [Advanced Recovery Companion](https://www.microsoft.com/p/advanced-recovery-companion/9p74z35sfrs8?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) from the Microsoft Store.
1. Download the [most recent HoloLens 2 release](https://aka.ms/hololens2download).
1. When you have finished these downloads, open **File explorer** > **Downloads**. Right-click the zipped folder that you just downloaded, and select **Extract all** > **Extract** to unzip it.
1. Connect your HoloLens to your PC using a USB-A to USB-C cable . (Even if you've been using other cables to connect your HoloLens, this one works best.)
1. The Advanced Recovery Companion automatically detects your HoloLens. Select the **Microsoft HoloLens** tile.
1. On the next screen, select **Manual package selection** and then select the installation file contained in the folder that you unzipped in step 4. (Look for a file with the .ffu extension.)
1. Select **Install software**, and follow the instructions.

## Go back to a previous version (HoloLens (1st gen))

In some cases, you might want to go back to a previous version of the HoloLens software. You can do this by using the Windows Device Recovery Tool to reset your HoloLens to the earlier version.

> [!NOTE]
> Going back to an earlier version deletes your personal files and settings.

To go back to a previous version of HoloLens (1st gen), follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you don't have any phones or Windows devices plugged in to your PC.
1. On your PC, download the [Windows Device Recovery Tool (WDRT)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12379).
1. Download the [HoloLens Anniversary Update recovery package](https://aka.ms/hololensrecovery).
1. When the downloads finish, open **File explorer** > **Downloads**. Right-click the zipped folder you just downloaded, and select **Extract all** > **Extract** to unzip it.
1. Connect your HoloLens to your PC using the micro-USB cable that it came with. (Even if you've been using other cables to connect your HoloLens, this one works best.)
1. The WDRT will automatically detect your HoloLens. Select the **Microsoft HoloLens** tile.
1. On the next screen, select **Manual package selection** and choose the installation file contained in the folder you unzipped in step 4. (Look for a file with the .ffu extension.)
1. Select **Install software**, and follow the instructions.

> [!NOTE]
> If the WDRT doesn't detect your HoloLens, try restarting your PC. If that doesn't work, select **My device was not detected**, select **Microsoft HoloLens**, and then follow the instructions.

# Use policies to manage updates to HoloLens

>[!NOTE]
>HoloLens (1st gen) devices must be [upgraded to Windows Holographic for Business](hololens1-upgrade-enterprise.md) to manage updates.

To configure how and when updates are applied, use the following policies:

- [Update/AllowAutoUpdate](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-allowautoupdate)
- [Update/ScheduledInstallDay](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-scheduledinstallday)
- [Update/ScheduledInstallTime](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-scheduledinstalltime)

To turn off the automatic check for updates, set the following policy to value **5** â€“ Turn off Automatic Updates:

- [Update/AllowAutoUpdate](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-allowautoupdate)

In Microsoft Intune, you can use **Automatic Update Behavior** to change this policy. (See [Manage software updates in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/windows-update-for-business-configure))

For devices on Windows 10, version 1607 only: You can use the following update policies to configure devices and get updates from the Windows Server Update Service (WSUS), instead of Windows Update:

- [Update/AllowUpdateService](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-allowupdateservice)
- [Update/RequireUpdateApproval](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-requireupdateapproval)
- [Update/UpdateServiceUrl](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update#update-updateserviceurl)

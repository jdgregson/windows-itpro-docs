## Changing language or keyboard

The setup process configures your HoloLens for a region and language. You can change this configuration by using the **Time & language** section of **Settings**.

> [!NOTE]
> Your speech and dictation language depends on the Windows display language.

## To change the Windows display language

1. Go to the **Start** menu, and then select **Settings** > **Time and language** > **Language**.
2. Select **Windows display language**, and then select a language.  

If the supported language youâ€™re looking for is not in the menu, follow these steps: 

1. Under **Preferred languages** select **Add a language**. 
2. Search for and add the language.
3. Select the **Windows display language** menu again and choose the language you added.

The Windows display language affects the following settings for Windows and for apps that support localization:

- The user interface text language.
- The speech language.
- The default layout of the on-screen keyboard.

## To change the keyboard layout

To add or remove a keyboard layout, open the **Start** menu and then select **Settings** > **Time & language** > **Keyboard**.

If your HoloLens has more than one keyboard layout, use the **Layout** key to switch between them. The **Layout** key is in the lower right corner of the on-screen keyboard.

> [!NOTE]
> The on-screen keyboard can use Input Method Editor (IME) to enter characters in languages such as Chinese. However, HoloLens does not support external Bluetooth keyboards that use IME.
> 
> While you use IME with the on-screen keyboard, you can continue to use a Bluetooth keyboard to type in English. To switch between keyboards, press ~.

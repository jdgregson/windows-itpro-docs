# HoloLens and holograms: Frequently asked questions

Here are some answers to questions you might have about using HoloLens, placing holograms, working with spaces, and more.

Any time you're having problems, make sure HoloLens is [charged up](https://support.microsoft.com/help/12627/hololens-charge-your-hololens). Try [restarting it](hololens-restart-recover.md) to see if that fixes things. And please use the Feedback app to send us info about the issue&mdash;you'll find it on the [**Start** menu](holographic-home.md).

For tips about wearing your HoloLens, see [HoloLens fit and comfort: FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/help/13405/hololens-fit-and-comfort-faq).

## My holograms don't look right or are moving around

If your holograms don't look right (for example, they're jittery or shaky, or you see black patches on top of them), try one of these fixes:

- [Clean your device visor](hololens1-hardware.md#care-and-cleaning) and make sure nothing is blocking the sensors.
- Make sure you're in a well-lit room without a lot of direct sunlight.
- Try walking around and gazing at your surroundings so HoloLens can scan them more completely.
- If you've placed a lot of holograms, try removing some.

If you're still having problems, trying running the Calibration app, which calibrates your HoloLens just for you, to help keep your holograms looking their best. Go to **Settings **>** System **>** Utilities**. Under Calibration, select **Open Calibration**.

## I see a message that says Finding your space

When HoloLens is learning or loading a space, you might see a brief message that says "Finding your space." If this message continues for more than a few seconds, you'll see another message under the Start menu that says "Still looking for your space."

These messages mean that HoloLens is having trouble mapping your space. When this happens, you'll be able to open apps, but you won't be able to place holograms in your environment.

If you see these messages often, try the following:

- Make sure you're in a well-lit room without a lot of direct sunlight.
- Make sure your device visor is clean. [Learn how](hololens1-hardware.md#care-and-cleaning).
- Make sure you have a strong Wi-Fi signal. If you enter a new environment that has no Wi-Fi or a weak signal, HoloLens won't be able find your space. Check your Wi-Fi connection by going to **Settings **> **Network &amp; Internet** >** Wi-Fi**.
- Try moving more slowly.

## I'm not seeing the holograms I expect to see in my space

If you don't see holograms you placed, or you're seeing some you don't expect, try the following:

- Try turning on some lights. HoloLens works best in a well-lit space.
- Remove holograms you don't need by going to **Settings** > **System** > **Holograms** > **Remove nearby holograms**. Or, if needed, select **Remove all holograms**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If the layout or lighting in your space changes significantly, your device might have trouble identifying your space and showing your holograms.

## I can't place holograms where I want

Here are some things to try if you're having trouble placing holograms:

- Stand about 1 to 3 meters from where you're trying to place the hologram.
- Don't place holograms on black or reflective surfaces.
- Make sure you're in a well-lit room without a lot of direct sunlight.
- Walk around the rooms so HoloLens can rescan your surroundings. To see what's already been scanned, air tap to reveal the mapping mesh graphic.

## Holograms disappear or are encased in other holograms or objects

If you get too close to a hologram, it will temporarily disappear&mdash;just move away from it. Also, if you've placed a lot of holograms close together, some may disappear. Try removing a few.

Holograms can also be blocked or encased by other holograms or by objects such as walls. If this happens, try one of the following:

- If the hologram is encased in another hologram, move it to another location: select **Adjust**, then tap and hold to position it.
- If the hologram is encased in a wall, select **Adjust**, then walk toward the wall until the hologram appears. Tap and hold, then pull the hologram forward and out of the wall.
- If you can't move the hologram with gestures, use your voice to remove it. Gaze at the hologram, then say "Remove." Then reopen it and place it in a new location.

## I can see holograms that are on the other side of a wall

If you're very close to a wall, or if HoloLens hasn't scanned the wall yet, you'll be able to see holograms that are in the next room. Stand 1 to 3 meters from the wall and gaze to scan it.

If HoloLens has problems scanning the wall, it might be because there's a black or reflective object nearby (for example, a black couch or a stainless steel refrigerator). If there is, scan the other side of the wall.

## When I place a hologram on a wall, it seems to float

Holograms placed on walls will appear to be an inch or so away from the wall. If they appear farther away, try the following:

- Stand 1 to 3 meters from the wall when you place a hologram and face the wall straight on.
- Air tap the wall to reveal the mapping mesh graphic. Make sure the mesh is lined up with the wall. If it isn't, remove the hologram, rescan the wall, and try again.
- If the issue persists, run the Calibration app. You'll find it in **Settings** > **System** > **Utilities**.

## Apps appear too close to me when I'm trying to move them

Try walking around and looking at the area where you're placing the app so HoloLens will scan it from different angles. [Cleaning your device visor](hololens1-hardware.md#care-and-cleaning) may also help.

## I'm getting a low disk space error

Free up some storage space by doing one or more of the following:

- Remove some of the holograms you've placed, or remove some saved data from within apps. [How do I find my data?](holographic-data.md)
- Delete some pictures and videos in the Photos app.
- Uninstall some apps from your HoloLens. In the All apps list, tap and hold the app you want to uninstall, then select **Uninstall**. (This will also delete any of the app's data stored on the device.)

## HoloLens doesn't respond to my gestures

To make sure HoloLens can see your gestures, keep your hand in the gesture frame, which extends a couple of feet on either side of you. HoloLens can also best see your hand when you hold it about 18 inches in front of your body (though you don't have to be precise about this). When HoloLens can see your hand, the cursor will change from a dot to a ring. Learn more about [using gestures in HoloLens 2](hololens2-basic-usage.md) or [using gestures in HoloLens (1st gen)](hololens1-basic-usage.md).

## HoloLens doesn't respond to my voice

If Cortana isn't responding to your voice, make sure Cortana is on. In the **All apps** list, select **Cortana** > **Menu** > **Notebook** > **Settings** to make changes. To learn more about what you can say, see [Use your voice with HoloLens](hololens-cortana.md).

## I'm having problems pairing or using a Bluetooth device

If you're having problems [pairing a Bluetooth device](hololens-connect-devices.md), try the following:

- Go to **Settings** > **Devices** and make sure Bluetooth is turned on. If it is, try turning if off and on again.
- Make sure your Bluetooth device is fully charged or has fresh batteries.
- If you still can't connect, [restart your HoloLens](hololens-recovery.md).

If you're having trouble using a Bluetooth device, make sure it's a supported device. Supported devices include:

- English-language QWERTY Bluetooth keyboards, which can be used anywhere you use the holographic keyboard.
- Bluetooth mice.
- The [HoloLens clicker](hololens1-clicker.md).

Other Bluetooth HID and GATT devices can be paired, but they might require a companion app from Microsoft Store to work with HoloLens.

HoloLens doesn't support Bluetooth audio profiles. Bluetooth audio devices, such as speakers and headsets, may appear as available in HoloLens settings, but they aren't supported.

## I'm having problems with the HoloLens clicker

Use the [clicker](hololens1-clicker.md) to select, scroll, move, and resize holograms. Additional clicker gestures may vary from app to app.

If you're having trouble using the clicker, make sure its charged and paired with your HoloLens. If the battery is low, the indicator light will blink amber. To see if its paired, go to **Settings** > **Devices** and see if it shows up there. [Pair the clicker](hololens-connect-devices.md#pair-the-clicker).

If the clicker is charged and paired and you're still having problems, reset it by holding down the main button and the pairing button for 15 seconds. Then pair the clicker with your HoloLens again.

If that doesn't help, see [Restart or recover the HoloLens clicker](hololens1-clicker.md#restart-or-recover-the-clicker).

## I can't connect to Wi-Fi

Here are some things to try if you can't connect to Wi-Fi on HoloLens:

- Make sure Wi-Fi is turned on. Bloom to go to Start, then select **Settings** > **Network &amp; Internet** > **Wi-Fi** to check. If Wi-Fi is on, try turning it off and on again.
- Move closer to the router or access point.
- Restart your Wi-Fi router, then [restart HoloLens](hololens-recovery.md). Try connecting again.
- If none of these things work, check to make sure your router is using the latest firmware. You can find this information on the manufacturers website.

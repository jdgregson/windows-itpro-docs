# Insider preview for Microsoft HoloLens

Welcome to the latest Insider Preview builds for HoloLens!  It’s simple to get started and provide valuable feedback for our next major operating system update for HoloLens.

## Start receiving Insider builds

On a device running the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, go to **Settings** -> **Update & Security** -> **Windows Insider Program** and select **Get started**. Link the account you used to register as a Windows Insider.

Then, select **Active development of Windows**, choose whether you’d like to receive **Fast** or **Slow** builds, and review the program terms.

Select **Confirm -> Restart Now** to finish up. After your device has rebooted, go to **Settings -> Update & Security -> Check for updates** to get the latest build.

## Stop receiving Insider builds

If you no longer want to receive Insider builds of Windows Holographic, you can opt out when your HoloLens is running a production build, or you can [recover your device](hololens-recovery.md) using the Windows Device Recovery Tool to recover your device to a non-Insider version of Windows Holographic.

To verify that your HoloLens is running a production build:

- Go to **Settings > System > About**, and find the build number.
- [See the release notes for production build numbers.](hololens-release-notes.md)

To opt out of Insider builds:

- On a HoloLens running a production build, go to **Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider Program**, and select **Stop Insider builds**.
- Follow the instructions to opt out your device.

## Provide feedback and report issues

Please use [the Feedback Hub app](hololens-feedback.md) on your HoloLens to provide feedback and report issues. Using Feedback Hub ensures that all necessary diagnostics information is included to help our engineers quickly debug and resolve the problem.  Issues with the Chinese and Japanese version of HoloLens should be reported the same way.

>[!NOTE]
>Be sure to accept the prompt that asks whether you’d like Feedback Hub to access your Documents folder (select **Yes** when prompted).

## Note for developers

You are welcome and encouraged to try developing your applications using Insider builds of HoloLens.  Check out the [HoloLens Developer Documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/development) to get started. Those same instructions work with Insider builds of HoloLens.  You can use the same builds of Unity and Visual Studio that you're already using for HoloLens development.
